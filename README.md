### Lessons Learned and Thanks

I learned a lot about creating servers, and using express with this application. I was able to effectively call a database using a db.json file for the first time, and I was able to effectively deploy my application on heroku. I was having a lot of trouble with pulling data for the application at first, but David Grant and others in my work group were able to help me fix all my errors.
